      <description>As I&#39;ve transitioned into being a Senior Manager, I feel like I&#39;ve had to quickly adapt and learn all sorts of new skills and techniques around the meta of squad management - the management of managers who manage squads.
One of the things that really used to irritate me as a squad lead were redundant meetings. You know them, you&#39;ve all sat through them - the meetings where you know almost everyone is doing something else and questions asked to the room are met by an aggressive level of silence and apathy.</description>

      <description>Every year, the idea comes round to write more. To consider things and actually commit them to&amp;hellip;paper? Or some such.
Anyway, this is my first post in my new blog - hosted by GitHub Pages, powered by Hugo and inspired by a theme which I&#39;ve adopted, changed and will continue to change as I learn this colouring-in malarky.</description>
