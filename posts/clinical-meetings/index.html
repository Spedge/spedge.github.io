  <article class='post_content'><p>As I've transitioned into being a Senior Manager, I feel like I've had to quickly adapt and learn all sorts of new skills and techniques around the meta of squad management - the management of managers who manage squads.</p>
<p>One of the things that really used to irritate me as a squad lead were <em>redundant meetings</em>. You know them, you've all sat through them - the meetings where you know almost everyone is doing something else and questions asked to the room are met by an aggressive level of silence and apathy.</p>
<p>Yet, in my first month at my new level, I found myself falling into the same trap, asking my squads to attend meetings where only a fraction of the individuals there were actually engaged. It even felt like the right thing to do to <em>include</em> everyone, to make sure everyone had the same opportunity to gain context and insight.</p>
<p>The realisation of this was crushing and I was so disappointed in myself. <em>&ldquo;Those that do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;</em>. Damn.</p>
<h2 id="bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Not all was lost though. I started by declaring myself meeting-bankrupt and admitted failure. I cancelled every meeting I owned - those I started and those I inherited - and started again but <em>clinically</em> limiting any meeting to as few people as possible. Tons of people were uninvited from recurring meetings but few people were concerned enough to actually speak to me about it.</p>
<p>It turns out this move has been almost everything I'd hoped for and I'm seeing really positive influences&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daytime is Precious</strong> : There's only so many hours in the day to work sustainably, so asking someone to attend a meeting is a really huge deal. People appreciate you leaving them out of shit meetings and then appreciate the value even more when they are asked to attend.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Safety</strong> : I believe I have more honest and candid conversations with the people in the meeting if there are fewer people there.</li>
<li><strong>Clearer Accountability</strong> : It's clear if you are in the room, you are not an observer. Contribution is expected, commitment to the outcomes is inferred.</li>
<li><strong>Being Present</strong> : It's far harder to hide or focus on Slack when there's only three of you in a meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Empowerment</strong> : It felt like a good signal to empower my squad leads with communicating to their squads rather than taking responsibility for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meetings are concluded quicker and actions are decided with minimal fuss - but I'm seeing a secondary effect that squads seem to be more focused on the actions they've been asked to accomplish. Too wide a lens has potentially been distracting for them&hellip;</p>
<p>I <em>strongly</em> recommend you experiment with this approach.</p>
<h2 id="next-iteration">Next Iteration</h2>
<p>My next iteration on this meeting format is to expect statuses for meetings to be pre-written and read by the participants before the meeting has begun. <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/jeff-bezos-self-discipline-writing/">Jeff Bezos runs this within his senior executive meetings at Amazon</a>, but I only expect that a minimal amount of writing is done to bring together the narrative of the active epics in a squad, leaning as much on the existing context as possible (I can read a JIRA ticket when forced to ;))</p>
<p>My intent behind this is to&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Written Communication</strong> : My squad leads need to be able to communicate effectively in a written format, so emphasizing it as such gives them the opportunity to practice. I only get to practice by doing this blog&hellip; ;)</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Engagement</strong> : By writing things down, it allows us to consume the details at our own pace and prepare for the meeting effectively rather than react to the situation in the room.</li>
<li><strong>Record of Achievement</strong> : Allows those in the meeting to also get a sense of the status of projects without having to attend, as well as giving us a clear audit trail of how things have progressed over the time frame - which is especially useful come personal review time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll report back with how this goes.</p>
